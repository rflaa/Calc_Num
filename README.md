# Numerical Calculus Notes and Implementations

This repository contains a collection of notes, code examples, and exercises developed during my **Numerical Calculus** course at University of Pernambuco, semester of 2025.2.  
The goal is to document key numerical methods and provide working Python implementations for study and experimentation.
